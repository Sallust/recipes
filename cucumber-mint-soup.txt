Ingredients:
	4 cucumbers, peeled and seeded
	1 small or 1/2 large clove garlic
	1 cup plain yogurt, low-fat if desired
	2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste
	1/4 cup water
	4 scallions, white and green parts, cut into 1-inch pieces
	3/4 cup fresh mint leaves, loosely packed
	Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
	Cut 1 cucumber into small dice, and set aside for garnish. Cut others into large chunks. Combine cucumber chunks, garlic, yogurt, lemon juice, and water in a blender, and puree until smooth.

	Add scallions and mint leaves, reserving some of the mint for garnish, and puree briefly. Season with salt and pepper, and add more lemon juice if a tarter flavor is desired.

	Chill until ready to serve. Stir well before serving, and ladle into bowls or mugs, garnishing each serving with a big spoonful of diced cucumber and a sprig of mint.
